How to Approach AWS Lambda Hackathon Problem Statement

AWS Lambda Hackathon – How to Approach and Brainstorm
Entering the AWS Lambda Hackathon means building a scalable, serverless application that solves a real-world problem using AWS Lambda at its core
awslambdahackathon.devpost.com
. The emphasis is on event-driven design: every project must use at least one Lambda trigger (for example, an API Gateway endpoint, an EventBridge event, or a Step Functions workflow)
awslambdahackathon.devpost.com
. You are encouraged to integrate other AWS services (S3, DynamoDB, SNS/SQS, Amazon Bedrock, etc.) to add functionality
awslambdahackathon.devpost.com
awslambdahackathon.devpost.com
. In practice, hackathon projects often focus on automation, data processing, and AI/ML – for example, a Lambda function that processes uploaded documents (perhaps using Bedrock for summarization), an image-processing pipeline triggered by S3, a real-time game leaderboard using Lambda+DynamoDB, or an alert system for emergencies
awslambdahackathon.devpost.com
awslambdahackathon.devpost.com
. Common focus areas include: building serverless APIs and microservices, real-time data analysis or notifications, and creative uses of generative AI. The hackathon’s tagline is “Build solutions that scale”, so scalable, pay-as-you-go architectures are key
awslambdahackathon.devpost.com
. For example, AWS provides inspiration examples like a Document Summarizer (Lambda + Amazon Bedrock for NLP), a Menu Text-to-Image Converter (Lambda + Bedrock Stable Diffusion), a Game Leaderboard (Lambda + API Gateway + DynamoDB), and more
awslambdahackathon.devpost.com
awslambdahackathon.devpost.com
. In short, aim to solve a real-world problem (business automation, community app, data analytics, etc.) using Lambda functions and triggers
awslambdahackathon.devpost.com
awslambdahackathon.devpost.com
.
Brainstorming Project Ideas
To come up with ideas, start by identifying everyday pain points or opportunities in domains you know. Consider broad themes like healthcare, education, environment, community support, productivity, and so on
aws-amplify-hackathon.devpost.com
 – these are popular hackathon categories that often spark ideas. For instance, you might think about a telemedicine app (healthcare), a tutoring or quiz platform (education), a sustainability tracker (environment), or a neighborhood safety notifier (community). Look at AWS’s Inspirations examples on the hackathon page (summarizer, image converter, leaderboard, etc.) to see what’s possible
awslambdahackathon.devpost.com
. Use structured idea-generation too. AWS has an AI-powered hackathon idea generator (the BrainstormForge PartyRock app) that, given some prompts, spins out project concepts
community.aws
. In practice, collaborate with your team: list problems you face or have read about, then ask “how could Lambda automate or scale a solution?” For example, automating workflows (e.g. notifying teams via chat), analyzing text or data (e.g. sentiment analysis of tweets), or building simple APIs (e.g. a ride-booking or booking system). Key tips for hackathons are also relevant: plan before you code and keep it simple
inspiritai.com
. Choose an idea that is feasible in the time frame (focus on one core feature) and aligns with your team’s skills
inspiritai.com
. Early on, sketch the architecture: which AWS trigger will start your Lambda, what inputs/outputs you need, and what services to integrate. Finally, use the community – join the hackathon’s Slack channel (#2025-lambda-hackathon) and AWS re:Post forum to float ideas and get feedback
awslambdahackathon.devpost.com
.
Examples of Notable AWS Lambda Projects
Looking at past projects can spark ideas. For instance, one hackathon-winning team built a real-time carpooling app using a fully serverless AWS backend
devpost.com
. They used AWS Lambda for core logic (user matching and routing), API Gateway for HTTP endpoints, Cognito for authentication, DynamoDB with geohash storage, and EventBridge for notifications
devpost.com
devpost.com
. This “Serverless Carpooling” project achieved low-latency ride matching without managing any servers
devpost.com
devpost.com
. Another notable project was “Among the Clouds” – a serverless re-creation of the game Among Us
devpost.com
. In this, the team ran the entire multiplayer game on AWS Serverless: a WebSocket API (API Gateway) handled real-time communication, AWS Lambda processed game logic (player moves, voting, etc.), and DynamoDB stored game state and user data
devpost.com
. The result was a globally scalable game with no dedicated servers
devpost.com
devpost.com
. Other examples include a financial data processor (“Watch-Your-Spend”) that ingests bank statement PDFs via S3, extracts transactions, and uses Lambda + Amazon Textract + Bedrock for analysis and summaries
devpost.com
devpost.com
. For a simpler use case, think of a game leaderboard API: Lambda functions behind API Gateway record and retrieve player scores in DynamoDB
awslambdahackathon.devpost.com
. These examples show how creative applications of Lambda (games, data analytics, finance, etc.) can be built in a hackathon setting.
Resources and Tutorials
AWS provides many resources to help beginners get started:
AWS Free Tier & Tutorials: Sign up for a free AWS account (Lambda includes 1 million free requests/month)
awslambdahackathon.devpost.com
. Follow official AWS tutorials and guides (e.g. the Getting Started with AWS Lambda walkthrough
awslambdahackathon.devpost.com
, AWS Lambda Developer Guide and Serverless Developer Guide) to learn the basics
awslambdahackathon.devpost.com
.
Workshops and Hands-On Labs: AWS has self-paced serverless workshops on workshops.aws covering topics like building APIs, event-driven workflows, and integrating services
awslambdahackathon.devpost.com
. The Serverless Land portal also aggregates tutorials, sample code, videos, and blogs for building Lambda apps
awslambdahackathon.devpost.com
.
AWS Documentation: Bookmark the AWS Lambda product page and official docs
awslambdahackathon.devpost.com
. The docs cover event sources, best practices, pricing, and sample code. Also explore service guides for related tools (e.g. Step Functions, EventBridge, DynamoDB) linked from the Lambda docs.
Community and Support: Join the hackathon’s Slack workspace (look for channel #2025-lambda-hackathon or similar) to ask questions and get peer feedback
awslambdahackathon.devpost.com
. Post technical questions on AWS re:Post (the official Q&A forum) with the aws-lambda tag
awslambdahackathon.devpost.com
. AWS Developer Advocates also host Serverless Office Hours on Twitch (weekly live Q&A sessions) during the hackathon
awslambdahackathon.devpost.com
 – bring your questions there to get expert advice.
Example Code and Samples: AWS publishes sample projects on GitHub (e.g. under aws-samples) and the Serverless Examples site. Reviewing simple examples (Slack bots, image processors, etc.) can spark ideas. The hackathon’s own Resources page also lists service recommendations (AWS Step Functions, EventBridge, Amazon Bedrock, etc.)
awslambdahackathon.devpost.com
 and practical inspirations (document summarizer, menu converter, etc.)
awslambdahackathon.devpost.com
 which can guide your approach.
Idea Generators: In addition to AWS’s BrainstormForge (PartyRock) hackathon tool
community.aws
, consider general hackathon project lists for inspiration (e.g. blog posts on creative Lambda projects). While building ideas, align with the hackathon’s judging criteria: prioritize originality and business value (Quality of Idea), solid serverless design (Architecture), and a working, well-documented solution (Completeness)
blog.techgroupkenya.co.ke
.
Real-Time Use-Case Suggestions
Lambda is ideal for real-time, event-driven tasks. Here are a few feasible project ideas for individuals or small teams:
Real-time Chatbot or Assistant: Create a serverless chatbot (e.g. Slack/Discord bot or web chat) that responds instantly. Use API Gateway or WebSocket APIs to trigger Lambdas. For example, a customer support FAQ bot, a study assistant answering questions, or an alert bot for team notifications. (You can use AWS Lex or Bedrock LLMs inside Lambda for NLP/AI responses.)
Live Data Processing/Analytics: Build a pipeline that ingests real-time data. For example, stream Tweets (via Kinesis or EventBridge), then use a Lambda chain to analyze sentiment (Amazon Comprehend) and store the results in DynamoDB or Elasticsearch. Display live dashboards or send alerts based on the data. This survey or sentiment analytics pattern is directly inspired by AWS ideas
awslambdahackathon.devpost.com
.
Serverless API/Mobile Backend: Develop a REST API for a simple app. E.g. a to-do list manager, event scheduler, or event-ticket booking system. API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB can handle all CRUD operations. Or implement a game leaderboard API: players submit scores to a Lambda function and retrieve high scores
awslambdahackathon.devpost.com
.
Media and Document Processing: Use Lambdas for on-the-fly media tasks. For example, an S3-triggered Lambda that generates thumbnails or GIFs from uploaded images (parallelizing work across functions, like the “GIF Builder” idea
awslambdahackathon.devpost.com
). Or make a document summarizer: user uploads text or PDF, a Lambda uses AWS Textract or Bedrock to summarize content in real time
awslambdahackathon.devpost.com
.
Alerts and Automation: Implement an event-driven alert system. For instance, a weather or system alert app: Lambda periodically checks a weather API (via EventBridge schedule) and pushes SMS/email alerts (SNS) if thresholds are met. Or a home monitoring tool: IoT or device events trigger Lambdas to notify you.
Generative AI Feature: Since Amazon Bedrock is encouraged, you could add generative AI to any app. E.g. a creative image generator (convert menu text to images
awslambdahackathon.devpost.com
), or a virtual assistant that takes voice/text input and uses Bedrock LLMs for responses. The key is Lambda handles the backend logic and calls the AI service.
All of these use cases can be built by a small team within weeks, leverage AWS’s pay-as-you-go scaling, and showcase Lambda’s strengths. As you implement them, be sure to document how Lambda is used (which triggers, how many functions, etc.) in your README and demo video

Updated saved memory
Great! You're on the right track with two solid AWS Lambda hackathon ideas. Let’s break them down so you can choose the one that plays better to your strengths, feasibility, and impact.

🔁 Quick Comparison: Survey Analytics vs. Disaster Recovery Agent
Feature/Aspect	Survey Analytics	Disaster Recovery Agent
Problem Type	Data analytics, ML (text summarization), batch/event-driven	Real-time response, workflow automation, event-driven architecture
Complexity	Moderate (data pipelines, Bedrock integration)	Higher (coordination, event triggers, Step Functions, alerts)
Lambda Role	Ingestion + Transformation + Summarization	Orchestration + Decision-making + Notification
Key AWS Services	Lambda, S3, Bedrock, DynamoDB, EventBridge (maybe SNS/SQS)	Lambda, Step Functions, EventBridge, SNS, DynamoDB
User-Facing Component	Dashboard/Reports or summary viewer (optional)	Notification system + admin interface (more moving parts)
Real-World Relevance	Scalable for business, education, research surveys	High impact for safety/public good, great story for portfolio
Feasibility for You	Easier to implement solo using docs & Bedrock guides	Challenging but impressive with Step Functions + event modeling
Risks	Requires good Bedrock prompting and data cleanup	Complex testing, needs simulation of disaster scenarios

🧩 Decomposing Each into Sub-Tasks
1. Survey Analytics – Sub-Problems
✅ Easier for someone with limited hands-on to build a working system.

Step 1: Survey Ingestion

Trigger: New survey file in S3 or API call

Lambda extracts questions & responses from JSON/CSV

Step 2: Data Storage

Store raw data in DynamoDB or S3

Step 3: Text Summarization with Bedrock

Lambda processes each response/question

Sends prompt to Bedrock Claude or Titan for summarization

Step 4: Summary Output

Save summaries to another S3 bucket or DB table

(Optional) Generate a PDF/HTML report

Step 5: Dashboard/Query API

Lambda + API Gateway can return summary stats via REST API

📌 Stretch Features: sentiment analysis, charts, filters

2. Disaster Recovery Agent – Sub-Problems
🚨 More challenging, but high-impact and great for showcasing AWS knowledge.

Step 1: Event Intake

Trigger: Incident alert via EventBridge (manual or simulated IoT/REST)

Step 2: Lambda MCP (Mission Control Process)

Decides: Type of incident → next steps

Invokes Step Functions or other Lambdas accordingly

Step 3: Orchestration with Step Functions

Tasks:

Notify responders via SNS

Log in DynamoDB

Call APIs (e.g., weather, GPS, etc.)

Monitor response times

Error handling & retries

Step 4: Feedback Loop

Confirm actions taken, update status

Store audit logs

📌 Stretch Features: mobile push alerts, admin panel, severity levels

⚠️ Challenges You Might Face
Challenge	Survey Analytics	Disaster Recovery Agent
Prompt engineering for Bedrock	Moderate – needs tuning for quality output	N/A
Event orchestration	Minimal – mostly sequential Lambda calls	High – Step Functions, timeouts, retries needed
Testing/Debugging	Easier – can use mock data easily	Tricky – need to simulate real-time events
Time to MVP	Faster – 1-2 weeks with docs	Slower – requires Step Functions understanding
UI/UX for Demo	Optional charts or summary viewer	Notification panel, dashboards (if added)

🎯 Recommendation for You

i think there are many existing tools that can doing this, what are unique feature that i can implement
a small easy one that can create a moderate impact


ChatGPT said:
You're right — survey summarization isn’t new. Tools like Google Forms, Typeform, or commercial NLP tools can already do basic sentiment and keyword extraction.

So to stand out in the AWS Lambda Hackathon, you want a unique angle or value-add that leverages AWS services in a clever but simple way — ideally small to build, but makes your app feel more intelligent or helpful.

✅ Simple + Unique Feature Ideas for SurveySynth
🌐 1. Language Auto-Detection + Translation
🔹 What it does: Auto-detects the language of survey responses (e.g., Hindi, Tamil) and translates them into English before summarization.

🔹 Why it matters: Useful for India-based or multilingual feedback scenarios. Most free tools don’t do this automatically.

🔹 AWS Services Used:

Amazon Comprehend (detect dominant language)

Amazon Translate (to English)

Amazon Bedrock (summary after translation)

🔹 Moderate impact: More inclusive, especially for diverse user bases.

🔍 2. Top 3 Actionable Insights
🔹 What it does: Instead of just summarizing, the AI identifies the top 3 things the team should act on.

🔹 Prompting trick: Add this to your Bedrock prompt:

nginx
Copy
Edit
Also provide 3 actionable suggestions the team should implement based on the feedback.
🔹 Why it's unique: Most tools summarize, but don’t give actions clearly.

🔹 No extra AWS services needed — just smart Bedrock prompting.

⏳ 3. Trend Detection Over Time
🔹 What it does: Compare the current batch of feedback to previous ones. “Are people happier now? Is login issue still common?”

🔹 AWS Services:

Store summaries in DynamoDB with timestamps

Use a Lambda to compare "this week's top complaints" to "last week"

🔹 Why it's valuable: Adds longitudinal insights in just a few lines of code.

📢 4. Emotion/Intensity Scoring
🔹 What it does: Beyond positive/negative, it scores how intense the emotion is.

🔹 Prompt example:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
For each response, estimate the emotion intensity on a scale of 1 to 5.
🔹 Why it's unique: A user can prioritize urgent or angry feedback automatically.

🗺️ 5. Geo-Based Feedback Summary
🔹 What it does: If survey includes “location” or “region,” summarize separately by region.

🔹 Why it’s smart: Adds “location intelligence” with minimal effort.

🔹 Bonus: Visualize with a static map or basic D3 chart (optional)

🔥 Pick ONE for Impact
If you want just one feature that’s easy to build but impactful, go with:

✅ “Top 3 Actionable Insights”

Great! Here's a clear and compelling problem statement you can use to align your team, brainstorm in PartyRock, or pitch your idea confidently to anyone (teammates, mentors, or judges).

🧠 Problem Statement for Brainstorming
Title: "SurveySynth: From Feedback to Action"

📌 Problem:
Organizations often collect hundreds of open-ended responses in surveys — from employees, users, or customers — but struggle to extract clear, actionable insights. Manual review is slow, tools often just give sentiment or word clouds, and there's no way to track feedback trends over time.

🎯 Our Goal:
To build a serverless, AI-powered feedback analyzer that:

Automatically summarizes survey feedback

Identifies the Top 3 actionable insights

Tracks trends across time (e.g., Are people still complaining about login issues compared to last month?)

🧰 Powered By:
AWS Lambda: Orchestrates the flow

Amazon S3: Survey file uploads and storage

Amazon Bedrock: Claude/Titan LLM for smart summarization and recommendations

DynamoDB: Stores historical insights by timestamp for trend comparison

Optional: SNS or API Gateway to notify or display results

🧪 Problem Statement (for PartyRock, teammates, or Hackathon template):
pgsql
Copy
Edit
We are solving the problem of converting large volumes of unstructured survey feedback into clear, prioritized, and actionable insights — and detecting changes in user sentiment or complaints over time.

Our solution uses AI (via Amazon Bedrock) to not only summarize feedback, but to recommend the top 3 actions the team should take. It also stores past feedback summaries in DynamoDB, so we can automatically detect recurring issues and trends (e.g., declining satisfaction or repeated complaints).

This makes feedback analysis faster, smarter, and more decision-oriented — especially for product teams, HR departments, or customer service teams who rely on user voice to guide improvements.
✅ Suggested Roles for Brainstorming Personas:
Role	Prompt Angle
CEO	"How can this product improve team decision-making and speed of response to user feedback?"
CFO	"Is this solution cost-efficient at scale, especially when deployed serverlessly?"
Marketing Manager	"Can this help us identify pain points in campaigns or product-market fit faster?"
Sales Director	"Can it show why leads or customers drop off — and help us fix those patterns over time?"
Notetaker	"Extract core insights from multiple meetings or feedback logs automatically."
Discuss	"What technical stack would make this scalable and fast for teams with limited ML experience?"

Let me know if you want:

A PartyRock app seed prompt

YAML/SAM project boilerplate

# SurveySynth – Smart Feedback Summarization and Trend Detection

## 🚀 About the Project

**SurveySynth** is a serverless, AI-powered solution designed to transform raw survey feedback into actionable business insights. We built this to address a common pain: organizations collect tons of open-ended responses but struggle to derive clear actions or understand sentiment trends over time. Most tools offer basic summaries or word clouds, but rarely help teams answer:  
👉 *"What should we do based on this feedback?"*  
👉 *"Are people complaining about the same issues again?"*

Our project extracts **Top 3 Actionable Insights** from any uploaded survey and detects **feedback trends across time** — helping product, HR, and support teams move from listening to acting.

---

## 💡 Inspiration

We were inspired by our own experience in product teams where we ran surveys but rarely had time to deeply analyze open-text responses. Manual review is time-consuming, and traditional tools don't provide strategic clarity. With the rise of large language models and scalable cloud infrastructure, we realized we could automate not just summarization, but also *decision-making signals* and *trend awareness*.

---

## 🧠 What We Learned

- How to integrate **Amazon Bedrock** (Claude/Titan) with AWS Lambda to prompt LLMs for high-quality summaries and recommendations
- How to structure prompts for **actionable output**, not just text summaries
- Using **DynamoDB time-stamped records** to compare previous feedback and detect trends
- Creating a fully **event-driven, serverless architecture** with AWS best practices
- Importance of batching and prompt engineering to stay within token limits

---

## 🛠️ How We Built It

- **Amazon S3**: Upload bucket for raw `.csv` survey files
- **AWS Lambda**:
  - `ingestSurvey`: triggered on S3 upload to parse and clean data
  - `summarizeFeedback`: calls Bedrock to extract summary + Top 3 actions
  - `saveInsights`: stores output to DynamoDB with timestamp
  - `compareTrends`: compares this week’s feedback to past data (manual trigger or scheduled)
- **Amazon Bedrock**: Used Claude/Titan models to generate intelligent, structured summaries
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: Stores insights by week/month for historical trend comparison
- **(Optional)**: API Gateway for report download, SNS for alerting if repeated complaints are detected

---

## ⚠️ Challenges We Faced

- **Prompt Tuning**: Getting Bedrock to reliably output structured, actionable suggestions took several iterations
- **Token Limits**: Batching responses to stay within LLM context windows required logic in Lambda
- **Trend Detection Logic**: Deciding how to define "similar complaint" across two different weeks
- **Debugging Async Flow**: Tracing multi-step Lambda executions via S3 triggers and logs was initially hard
- **Bedrock Quotas**: Managing request limits while testing multiple models in short time

---

## ✅ Outcome

- Upload any `.csv` survey with free-text feedback → get a structured summary + top actions
- Automatically stores previous results and compares them to detect **repeated issues**
- Fully serverless: scalable, fast, and cheap to run
- Positioned as a reusable tool for any team that relies on customer or employee feedback
