Application Title: Survey Report Analyzer For Course Instructors
User will logged into the website, we will give a unique id,
Phase-1
User Uploads the CSV, 
send to s3 (raw data).. the file needs to save with the user unique id.append(the count of this file).. I think we can use hash map(key,value) to append count to it

phase-2
Then pre processing using glue, that csv file uses some sort of ETL technique (yet to be decided),
What columns it have, 
That needs to send another ai model, that can give what insights can we get from those columns, 
If it have column like feedback or comment section we can perform sentiment analysis, to segregate positive, negative neutral


spark pre processing, will upload again in s3 (refined_data folder) will be saved with user_Id appended with count can hash map(key, value) be used
what else can we do::
display dashboard may be we can use Quick sight (not yet planned what dashboards may require)
phase 3
That csv files in refined folder, may trigger lambda function that can trigger bedrock and quick sight to display some useful dash boards,  and actionable insights
